# Mc API©️
The API we have that nobody asked for.
I worked at Discord McDonald's for a bit now, and it's fun! But finding images for the orders is a pain. I created this to simplify it.
Just place your order prompt into the text box and it will give you the images.
Note that I have not yet found a way to make it so it will return the images to discord for some reason though.
This API is still in Development.
